# Privacy Policy for Talent Direct Auto fill

**Last Updated: March 26, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
This extension is designed to help users automate the process of filling job application forms. We deeply value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. Our architecture is built so that you maintain complete ownership of your data at all times.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
- **Local Storage Only**: All extension data is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's secure `storage.local` API. We do not operate a backend service or maintain centralized databases of user resumes or application activity.
- **Data Processed Locally**: The extension locally processes the resume data you upload, any optional PDF or DOCX resume attachment you choose to store, supported job application page content, form field labels and values needed for autofill, and your application history entries such as job URL, company name, role, status, and timestamp.
- **No Background Telemetry**: The extension does not silently collect analytics, telemetry, or transmit your browsing activity in the background. It only activates on supported job application pages or when you explicitly trigger a manual fill action.
- **No Third-Party AI Data Sharing**: All AI fallback integrations have been removed. Your resume data and page/form data remain on your local machine and are never sent by this extension to external AI processing APIs or our own servers.

## 3. Permissions Justification
To securely provide intelligent auto-filling functionality, we request the following permissions:
- **`activeTab`**: Powers the "Force Fill Data" context menu on custom white-labeled ATS domains, allowing you to manually inject the script without requiring pervasive background access.
- **`storage`**: Used to save your resume profiles, optional attached resume file, autofill settings, overlay position, job queue state, and local application history.
- **`host_permissions` (Specific ATS Domains)**: We strictly whitelist major Applicant Tracking Systems (e.g., Workday, Lever, Greenhouse) rather than requesting `<all_urls>`. This ensures our auto-fill scripts only execute on supported career pages and limits access to the minimum set of sites required for the extension's single purpose.
- **`sidePanel`**: Provides a convenient interface for managing your resume profiles and reviewing application histories.

## 4. Your Rights
Because your data is exclusively stored locally, you maintain complete and total control over it. You can permanently delete your data at any time by:
1. Deleting your profile via the extension's side panel.
2. Clearing the extension's local storage data in Chrome.
3. Simply uninstalling the extension.

## 5. Contact
For any questions or concerns regarding this policy or how your data is handled, please contact us through our Chrome Web Store support channel.
